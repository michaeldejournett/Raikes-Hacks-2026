This tour is free and open to everyone. Space is limited; registration is encouraged. \"In the Studio\" Whether a pristine, laboratory like space for artistic experimentation, a place of creative chaos, or a bustling hub of social exchange, the space where an artist works is inevitably linked to their processes and the resulting creative output. An artist's decision to showcase their studio in their work is often synonymous with creating a self portrait, whether in a literal or metaphorical sense. \"Diasporas\" Whether forced or voluntary, the movement of people prompts the dispersal and exchange of ideas as well as visual forms. Modern art was profoundly shaped by nineteenth- and twentieth century migrations between countries and continents. This gallery celebrates artists from various diasporas who made work in the United States. About Magdalena Moskalewicz Magdalena Moskalewicz, PhD, is chief curator and associate director for curatorial affairs at the Sheldon Museum of Art. She is an art historian, curator, and author specializing in late modernism, neo-avant-gardes, and contemporary art in a global context. Moskalewicz's work engages in revisionist rewriting of art histories; her exhibitions, publications, and collaborations with living artists critically investigate particular histories, localities, and identities with the goal of reshaping dominant narratives. Born in Warsaw, Poland, she has worked at collecting, exhibiting, and academic institutions internationally, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the 56th Venice Biennale, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and FRONT International in Cleveland. She joined Sheldon in early 2025. Status: CONFIRMED | |",

Dr. Checco grew up in the Twin Cities, Minnesota and obtained his B.A. in Chemistry and Mathematics from St. Olaf College in 2010, and played clarinet in the St. Olaf Band. Checco received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2015 under the mentorship of Sam Gellman, where his research focused on developing methods to inhibit protein-protein interactions using non-natural peptide \"foldamers\". After completing his Ph.D., Checco was a Beckman Institute Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the mentorship of Jonathan Sweedler, where he studied the molecular functions of neuropeptides. In 2019, Checco joined the Chemistry faculty at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where his lab studies the molecular details of cell-to-cell communication by endogenous peptides. The ultimate goals of this research are both to understand fundamental processes in cellular communication and to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention. The Checco lab has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and industry. Checco's work has been recognized by a number of awards, including a COBRE Rising Star Award and an International Chemical Biology Society Young Chemical Biologist Award.

At the same time, environmental stressors like habitat loss, pollution, and climate change put pressure on bird populations. Grassland birds especially have suffered the biggest declines of any biome since 1970. The eastern Great Plains are a hotspot of population loss due to habitat conversion, tree and shrub encroachment, and pesticide application. And still, 96 million people in the U.S. (3 in 10 people) engage in bird watching. This panel of scientists and artists explores why humans are so connected to our feathered friends and what the future may hold for them. As part of the Center for Great Plains Studies' 50th anniversary, we're taking our Paul A.

Connect to your local lands and waterways during Hensen's performance of \"Remember the Way.\" Together, we will journey through the interconnected waterways and shifting landscapes of the planet guided by cultural keystone animals - whales, cranes, sturgeon and bison. Using puppets, masks, and dance props, we will bring these beings to life through a game of embodied animal role-playing, immersing ourselves in their journeys and behaviors. Through rhythmic dance games, song circles, crafting, and interactive storytelling, we'll explore the seasonal cycles, planetary movements, and water's flow from rivers to the ocean - helping us understand the profound connection between the water systems in our own backyards and the ocean beyond. Enjoy free access to the IQM and its galleries as well as an all-ages art project! When: March 6 from 4-7 p.m., performance starts at 5:30 p.m. Where: IQM Reception Hall. 1523 N. 33rd St. Lincoln, NE.

To commemorate these milestones, this exhibition highlights artworks from the collection that span the museum's history, from the founding donation to recent acquisitions. Rather than presenting these selections in a chronological arrangement, artworks are paired or grouped to focus on formal and thematic connections and emphasize the diverse perspectives that tell the multifaceted stories of the Great Plains. \"'All the Beauty You Can See': Dwight Kirsch in Nature\" January 20-July 25, 2026 A native Nebraskan and prolific artist, Dwight Kirsch (1899-1981) was an important figure in the Lincoln arts community in the early-to-mid twentieth century, serving as chair of the University of Nebraska Art Department and playing an integral role in the Nebraska Art Association. The Great Plains Art Museum's extensive collection of Kirsch's work spans his time teaching in Nebraska through his last years at the Colorado State Veterans Nursing Home. This exhibition presents a small sampling of those holdings, each selected to demonstrate Kirsch's deep and lifelong fascination with conveying the nuances and beauty of the natural world through art. \"Indigenous Ceramics from the Collection\" January 20-July 25, 2026 This permanent collection spotlight exhibition in the museum's Mezzanine Gallery features diverse ceramic works by Indigenous artists of the Great Plains and nearby Southwest region.

This panel invites us to confront that history with honesty, honor those who never returned home, and understand how each of us can help carry truth and healing forward. About the Genoa Indian Industrial School In operation from 1884 through 1934, the Indian Industrial School at Genoa was the fourth largest non-reservation boarding school established by the United States Office of Indian Affairs. The village of Genoa, Nebraska was selected because the US federal government already owned the former Pawnee Reservation property there. The facility's mission was to educate Native American children to assimilate them into American society. The students at Genoa Indian School were from more than ten states and over 40 different tribal nations. In time, the school grew from the original 74 students to an enrollment of 599 in a single year and encompassed over 30 buildings on 640 acres.Status: CONFIRMED | |",

Meredith Willson’s six-time, Tony Award-winning musical comedy The Music Man follows fast-talking traveling salesman, Harold Hill, as he cons the people of River City, Iowa, into buying instruments and uniforms for a boys’ band that he vows to organize – this, despite the fact that he doesn’t know a trombone from a treble clef. His plans to skip town with the cash are foiled when he falls for Marian, the librarian, who transforms him into a respectable citizen by curtain’s fall.

      "description": "Throughout American legal history, biblical texts and themes have populated the nation's legal and political discourse. Many of the country's most divisive issues - such as gender, sexuality, and race - are deeply intertwined with people's religious beliefs. As a result, the moral reasoning embedded in certain legal discussions often reflects the intersection of biblically based ideas and public policy. In this lecture, Dr. Joel Kemp examines how the 2023 SFFA decision continues this trend of drawing on biblical concepts to articulate legal conclusions. He focuses particularly on the majority and concurring opinions' invocation of Ezekiel 18 and their treatment of vicarious punishment. Dr. Kemp highlights how both the biblical text and the Supreme Court's decision engage with questions of intergenerational punishment within broader debates about national identity and history. This event is Co-sponsored by the Department of Classics and Religious Studies, the Department of Political Science, the Forsythe Family Program on Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, and the Institute for Ethnic Studies.

Cobb) and Johnny's right-hand man, Terry's brother, Charley (Rod Steiger), as the authorities close in on them.

After a tender courtship, he marries Gladys (Academy Award-nominee Felicity Jones) and they build a home together, though his work often takes him far from her and their young daughter.

This trip is a great chance to slow down and decompress, as we spend multiple days on the river, with no resupplies or stops at restaurants in between the put-in and the take-out. You’ll have some great conversations with new friends as you paddle in the tight canyons forged by iconic watersheds of the remote desert and explore side canyons or remains of villages. Find something worth telling stories about when you return from break. Given the remoteness and challenging rapids of this trip, this trip will require participants to be actively involved in paddling and learning how to navigate the rapids.

Orphaned at a young age, Robert grows into adulthood among the towering forests of the Pacific Northwest, where he helps expand the nation's railroad empire alongside men as unforgettable as the landscapes they inhabit. After a tender courtship, he marries Gladys (Academy Award-nominee Felicity Jones) and they build a home together, though his work often takes him far from her and their young daughter.

      "description": "Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping how educational media are designed, adapted, and evaluated, yet much of the current discourse focuses on tool novelty rather than principled design. This talk examines how generative AI can be systematically integrated into educational media to support learning, reflection, and adaptive feedback without displacing pedagogical intent or learner agency. Drawing on design-based research and learning sciences perspectives, the talk introduces a design-oriented framework for generative AI-enhanced educational media that foregrounds (1) pedagogical alignment, (2) learner-AI interaction dynamics, and (3) evidence-centered learning analytics. Through examples from AI-mediated simulations, intelligent digital textbooks, and game-based learning environments, the talk illustrates how generative AI can function as a co-designer, adaptive scaffold, and analytic lens rather than a content replacement engine. Particular attention is given to how generative models can support formative feedback, reflective sense-making, and personalization while maintaining transparency, equity, and interpretability. The talk concludes by outlining design tensions, ethical considerations, and research directions for advancing generative AI as a robust educational media infrastructure rather than a standalone instructional technology. Speaker Bio: Jewoong Moon, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor of Instructional Technology in the Department of Educational Leadership, Policy, and Technology Studies at The University of Alabama. His research focuses on generative AI-enhanced learning environments, educational media design, immersive technologies (XR), and learning analytics.

Still, as the play counts down to the launch of Apollo 11, Koelle is befriended by a Jewish engineer who is hell-bent on exposing the truth: the Germans’ technology is based on the V-2 rockets built by slave labor more tied to Koelle’s world than he can imagine.

As a result, our classes are small (limited to no more than 24 students), and focus on the basics of driving skills, safety, attitudes and behaviors. The course consists of 20 or more hours of classroom instruction and 5 hours of behind-the-wheel driving instruction. Passing the course results in the waiver of written and driving tests at the Nebraska DMV unless the student is 18 or older. Persons 18 or older will receive a certificate but are required to test at the DMV. The cost of the course is $380. The registration deadline is February 23.

Told through the point of view of Heinz- Hermann Koelle, a lesser-known young German rocketeer, who joined this “Operation Paperclip” team several years later, the play explores the dynamic relationship of Wernher von Braun and Koelle as these two have set their sights on space exploration and colonization beyond the moon. Still, as the play counts down to the launch of Apollo 11, Koelle is befriended by a Jewish engineer who is hell-bent on exposing the truth: the Germans’ technology is based on the V-2 rockets built by slave labor more tied to Koelle’s world than he can imagine. A startling new play about the intersection of scientific exploration and moral responsibility, The Rocket Men asks what it means “to be an American”. The Rocket Men is a new play by award-winning playwright Crystal Skillman. This unique production is part of a National New Play Network Rolling World Premiere happening across the country with The Phoenix Theatre, Synchronicity Theatre, and Angels Theatre.Status: CONFIRMED | |",

Heroic tenor Michael Spyres stars opposite Davidsen as the love-drunk Tristan. The momentous occasion also marks the advent of a new, Met-debut staging by Yuval Sharon-hailed by The New York Times as \"the most visionary opera director of his generation\" and the first American to direct an opera at the famed Wagner festival in Bayreuth-as well as Music Director Yannick Nzet-Sguin's first time leading Tristan und Isolde at the Met. Mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Gubanova reprises her portrayal of Brangne, alongside bass-baritone Tomasz Konieczny, who sings Kurwenal after celebrated Met appearances in Wagner's Der Fliegende Hollnder and Ring cycle.

      "description": "Six women step into the roles of the former Nazis who sent us to the moon to share with us a story about the team that formed the backbone of NASA in the most unlikely of places...North Alabama. Told through the point of view of Heinz- Hermann Koelle, a lesser-known young German rocketeer, who joined this “Operation Paperclip” team several years later, the play explores the dynamic relationship of Wernher von Braun and Koelle as these two have set their sights on space exploration and colonization beyond the moon. Still, as the play counts down to the launch of Apollo 11, Koelle is befriended by a Jewish engineer who is hell-bent on exposing the truth: the Germans’ technology is based on the V-2 rockets built by slave labor more tied to Koelle’s world than he can imagine. A startling new play about the intersection of scientific exploration and moral responsibility, The Rocket Men asks what it means “to be an American”. The Rocket Men is a new play by award-winning playwright Crystal Skillman. This unique production is part of a National New Play Network Rolling World Premiere happening across the country with The Phoenix Theatre, Synchronicity Theatre, and Angels Theatre.Status: CONFIRMED | |",

After years of anticipation, a truly unmissable event arrives in cinemas worldwide on March 21 as the electrifying Lise Davidsen tackles one of the ultimate roles for dramatic soprano: the Irish princess Isolde in Wagner's transcendent meditation on love and death. Heroic tenor Michael Spyres stars opposite Davidsen as the love-drunk Tristan. The momentous occasion also marks the advent of a new, Met-debut staging by Yuval Sharon-hailed by The New York Times as \"the most visionary opera director of his generation\" and the first American to direct an opera at the famed Wagner festival in Bayreuth-as well as Music Director Yannick Nzet-Sguin's first time leading Tristan und Isolde at the Met. Mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Gubanova reprises her portrayal of Brangne, alongside bass-baritone Tomasz Konieczny, who sings Kurwenal after celebrated Met appearances in Wagner's Der Fliegende Hollnder and Ring cycle.

Her award-winning book, The Upswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It Again, coauthored with Robert Putnam, offers an energizing and deeply researched message of hope during a dark time in America’s history. Her commentary has appeared in various outlets including NPR, PBS Newshour, the BBC, Deseret Magazine, TIME Magazine and the New York Times. Romney Garrett holds a degree in Government from Harvard University and has served in the Peace Corps. She spent six years in Jordan working to catalyze youth social innovation there.

She is a member of the Braver Angels Scholars Council, Citizen University’s Civic Collaboratory, and the Faith Matters Initiative Advisory Board. Based on her award-winning book co-written with Robert Putnam, Shaylyn Romney Garrett’s presentation offers an evidence-based roadmap for how to reweave our tattered social fabric. Through stories and data drawn from over a century of history, Garrett speaks passionately about how everyday Americans once changed the course of our nation by building a culture of “we”—and can do it again.

For our 50th anniversary, the annual Great Plains conference will celebrate our past and look to the next 50 years and beyond. This conference invites us to dream big about the future of people and land in our region. Join us for an interdisciplinary conference featuring keynotes, panels, workshops, and special events in Lincoln, Neb. As we look to explore the future of the region, keynotes and panels will focus on four interconnected themes: environmental futures, re-imagining the rural, Indigenous futures, and demographic change and migration. Keynotes: Danielle Boyer, \"From Bytes to Bright Futures: Meet the SkoBots\" Join Anishinaabe (Sault Tribe) youth robotics inventor Danielle Boyer as she explores how culturally grounded technology can reshape education, empower communities, and revitalize languages. Growing up under the poverty line and witnessing firsthand the barriers to technical education, Danielle created the SkoBots, wearable, personal language-learning robots to teach Anishinaabemowin. Built with affordability, sustainability, and cultural relevance in mind, her robots cost less than $100 to produce and are distributed free to Indigenous youth. Danielle shares how she has reached over one million students globally, disbursed tens of thousands of robots, and built a movement rooted in community, grassroots innovation, and intergenerational knowledge. J.S. Onsimo (Ness) Sndoval, \"Demography as an Analytic Lens: Latino Population Growth and the Demographic Transformation of the Midwest\" This talk explores how Latino population growth is reshaping the social, economic, and political landscape of the Midwest. By examining historical settlement patterns, contemporary demographic shifts, and projected trends, it highlights how Latindad has become an essential force driving regional transformation. Using demography as an analytic lens, the presentation connects statistical evidence with lived experience to reveal the far-reaching economic and political consequences of demographic change showing how Latino are redefining the future of Midwestern identity, governance, and opportunity. Shaylyn Romney Garrett, \"America's Upswing\" Co-hosted with the E.N. Thompson Forum on World Issues at the Lied Center for Performing Arts. Separate (free) tickets required. Social entrepreneur and coauthor of \"The Upswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It Again,\" Garrett has shared her opinions, writing, and research in numerous outlets including TIME Magazine, The New York Times, National Public Radio, BBC Radio, and the PBS Newshour. Her nonprofit work has been featured by the New York Times, FastCompany, LinkedIn, and Harvard Business Review. Neil Linscheid, \"Community Usability: Designing Communities for People (And Not the Other Way Around)\" What makes a community truly work for the people who live there? Across the Midwest and beyond, communities are moving past simply collecting data about newcomers, residents, and entrepreneurs. They're using that information to fundamentally redesign how their towns and cities function. This talk examines what's working, what's not, and what we can learn from communities that are getting it right. We'll look at communities that have reimagined how newcomers access essential services, how entrepreneurs navigate local systems, and how long-time residents connect with changing resources. We'll also examine what happens when communities stop designing for an idealized resident and start designing for the real, diverse people already there. Carol Graham, \"Success in Conservation; Partnering with Producers and Private Landowners\" Manitoba Habitat Conservancy (MHC) has been delivering conservation programs on private lands across southern Manitoba for 40 years. Enhancing habitat for species at risk and managing wetlands for waterfowl has required partnerships with producers, landowners, and industry. An emphasis on a collaborative approach has resulted in successful securement, enhancement, and mitigation of wildlife habitats in Manitoba. This community approach not only maintains ecological integrity and promotes biodiversity but also ensures ecosystem resilience and long-term ecological stability, beneficial for both producers and private landowners. Graham will speak about lessons learned and successes achieved over the years with programs that target native grassland management for wildlife and livestock production, upland enhancement for nesting habitats, and wetland retention and restoration for waterfowl.

      "description": "Roque Raquel Salas Rivera reads from his new book, \"Algaraba: The Song of Cenex, Natural Son of the Isle Alarabyya,\" an epic poem that follows the journey of Cenex, a trans being who retrospectively narrates his life while navigating the stories told on his behalf. An inhabitant of Algaraba, a colony of Earth in a parallel universe, Cenex struggles to find a name, a body, and a stable home. The song of Cenex weaves and clashes texts by cis writers on trans figures with fragments from historical, legal, and other nonliterary texts. Cenex leads us through his childhood hospitalization, his years as an experimental subject, a brief stay in suburbia, twisted meanderings, and not-so-far-off lands accompanied by a merry band of chosen queers. Referencing everything from pop culture to Taino cosmology and philosophy (at times in a single line), this book laughs at its own survival with sharp, unserious rage. The edition is composed of two original texts-one written in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish, the other in a reconsideration of English. \"Algaraba\" inscribes an origin narrative for trans people in the face of their erasure from both colonial and anti-colonial literary canons. Algaraba es una epopeya que sigue el viaje de Cenex, un ser trans que narra su vida retrospectivamente mientras navega por las historias contadas en su nombre. Habitante de Algaraba, una colonia de la Tierra en un universo paralelo, Cenex lucha por encontrar un nombre, un cuerpo y un hogar estables. El canto de Cenex entreteje y enfrenta textos de escritores cis sobre figuras trans con fragmentos de textos histricos, documentos legales y otras fuentes extraliterarias. Su protagonista nos conduce a travs de su hospitalizacin temprana, sus aos como sujeto experimental, una breve estancia suburbana, meandros retorcidos y unas tierras no tan lejanas en la compaa de un grupo jovial de cuirs predilectos. Poblado de referencias a la cultura popular, la cosmologa tana y la filosofa (a veces dentro de un mismo verso), este libro se re de su propia supervivencia con una rabia pcara y aguda. La epopeya se compone de dos textos originales: uno que fue escrito en espaol puertorriqueo y el otro que fue escrito en un ingls alterado. Algaraba inscribe un origen para las personas trans ante su exclusin de los cnones literarios coloniales y anticoloniales. Status: CONFIRMED | |",

For 60 years, Queen Elizabeth II met with each of her 12 prime ministers in a private weekly meeting. This meeting is known as The Audience. From Winston Churchill to Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron, the Queen advised her prime ministers on matters both public and personal. Through these private audiences, we see glimpses of the woman behind the crown and witness the moments that shaped a monarch. Peter Morgan's Netflix phenomenon The Crown was based on this hit play that was captured live from London's West End in 2013 and went on to become one of the most-watched NT Live productions.Ross EventStatus: CONFIRMED | |",

For our 50th anniversary, the annual Great Plains conference will celebrate our past and look to the next 50 years and beyond. This conference invites us to dream big about the future of people and land in our region. Join us for an interdisciplinary conference featuring keynotes, panels, workshops, and special events in Lincoln, Neb. As we look to explore the future of the region, keynotes and panels will focus on four interconnected themes: environmental futures, re-imagining the rural, Indigenous futures, and demographic change and migration. Keynotes: Danielle Boyer, \"From Bytes to Bright Futures: Meet the SkoBots\" Join Anishinaabe (Sault Tribe) youth robotics inventor Danielle Boyer as she explores how culturally grounded technology can reshape education, empower communities, and revitalize languages. Growing up under the poverty line and witnessing firsthand the barriers to technical education, Danielle created the SkoBots, wearable, personal language-learning robots to teach Anishinaabemowin. Built with affordability, sustainability, and cultural relevance in mind, her robots cost less than $100 to produce and are distributed free to Indigenous youth. Danielle shares how she has reached over one million students globally, disbursed tens of thousands of robots, and built a movement rooted in community, grassroots innovation, and intergenerational knowledge. J.S. Onsimo (Ness) Sndoval, \"Demography as an Analytic Lens: Latino Population Growth and the Demographic Transformation of the Midwest\" This talk explores how Latino population growth is reshaping the social, economic, and political landscape of the Midwest. By examining historical settlement patterns, contemporary demographic shifts, and projected trends, it highlights how Latindad has become an essential force driving regional transformation. Using demography as an analytic lens, the presentation connects statistical evidence with lived experience to reveal the far-reaching economic and political consequences of demographic change showing how Latino are redefining the future of Midwestern identity, governance, and opportunity. Shaylyn Romney Garrett, \"America's Upswing\" Co-hosted with the E.N. Thompson Forum on World Issues at the Lied Center for Performing Arts. Separate (free) tickets required. Social entrepreneur and coauthor of \"The Upswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It Again,\" Garrett has shared her opinions, writing, and research in numerous outlets including TIME Magazine, The New York Times, National Public Radio, BBC Radio, and the PBS Newshour. Her nonprofit work has been featured by the New York Times, FastCompany, LinkedIn, and Harvard Business Review. Neil Linscheid, \"Community Usability: Designing Communities for People (And Not the Other Way Around)\" What makes a community truly work for the people who live there? Across the Midwest and beyond, communities are moving past simply collecting data about newcomers, residents, and entrepreneurs. They're using that information to fundamentally redesign how their towns and cities function. This talk examines what's working, what's not, and what we can learn from communities that are getting it right. We'll look at communities that have reimagined how newcomers access essential services, how entrepreneurs navigate local systems, and how long-time residents connect with changing resources. We'll also examine what happens when communities stop designing for an idealized resident and start designing for the real, diverse people already there. Carol Graham, \"Success in Conservation; Partnering with Producers and Private Landowners\" Manitoba Habitat Conservancy (MHC) has been delivering conservation programs on private lands across southern Manitoba for 40 years. Enhancing habitat for species at risk and managing wetlands for waterfowl has required partnerships with producers, landowners, and industry. An emphasis on a collaborative approach has resulted in successful securement, enhancement, and mitigation of wildlife habitats in Manitoba. This community approach not only maintains ecological integrity and promotes biodiversity but also ensures ecosystem resilience and long-term ecological stability, beneficial for both producers and private landowners. Graham will speak about lessons learned and successes achieved over the years with programs that target native grassland management for wildlife and livestock production, upland enhancement for nesting habitats, and wetland retention and restoration for waterfowl.

For 60 years, Queen Elizabeth II met with each of her 12 prime ministers in a private weekly meeting. This meeting is known as The Audience. From Winston Churchill to Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron, the Queen advised her prime ministers on matters both public and personal. Through these private audiences, we see glimpses of the woman behind the crown and witness the moments that shaped a monarch. Peter Morgan's Netflix phenomenon The Crown was based on this hit play that was captured live from London's West End in 2013 and went on to become one of the most-watched NT Live productions.Ross EventStatus: CONFIRMED | |",

In this lecture, Olivia Weisser, Associate Professor of History at the University of Massachusetts Boston, explores London between 1650 and 1750 through the unexpected lens of a shameful sexually transmitted disease. While venereal disease was widespread, the lived experiences of those who carried it have often been hidden from history. Moving beyond medical institutions and learned texts, the talk follows patients into the streets, shops, and homes where treatment was sought and sold. Drawing on more than 700 advertisements for cures, it reveals a bustling underground marketplace in which pills and potions were offered not only by healers, but discreetly by bakers, grocers, and other everyday retailers-foreshadowing a booming proprietary drug trade far earlier than historians once believed.The Dreaded Pox: Sex and Disease in Early Modern LondonStatus: CONFIRMED | |",

As the United States celebrates the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the exhibition explores these questions by showcasing how identity is presented and interrogated in visual art.

With his senses-ravishing third feature, visionary director Bi Gan takes his deepest plunge yet into the realm of pure cinematic dreamscape. In a world where humans have forsaken dreams in exchange for immortality, a dreaming monster (Jackson Yee) embarks on a shape-shifting odyssey through illusion, beauty, and terror that takes him across the twentieth century and to the end of time. Unfolding in five dazzlingly imagined chapters that encompass everything from silent-cinema expressionism to film noir to a delirious vampire love story shot in one of Bi's signature long takes, Resurrection is a work of breathtaking imagination in which cinema is the ultimate portal to the unconscious mind.

Women in the Italian Parliament came to work the next day wearing jeans in solidarity with the victim/survivor.

A MacArthur \"Genius\" Grant and Right Livelihood Award recipient, Jackson has been lauded by the Smithsonian, The Atlantic and The New York Times, among many others, and named \"One of the 18 most important Americans of the 20th Century.\" Jackson co-founded The Land Institute, also in its 50th year, as a nonprofit educational organization exploring sustainable alternatives in agriculture, energy, shelter, and waste disposal. In addition to being a scientist and geneticist who has focused on agriculture, Jackson is also a philosopher, educator, author, and organizer. He has spent his life seeking solutions through innovative thought and multi-disciplinary approaches, inspiring others to mimic the wisdom inherent in ecosystems. See the trailer at: https://www.prairieprophecy.com Aubrey Streit Krug grew up in rural Kansas, where her parents farm wheat and raise cattle, and her curiosity about prairie stories and plants led her to earn a PhD in English and Great Plains Studies. Aubrey is drawn to the possibility of more just human communities grounded in place and nourished by diverse, perennial food systems. At The Land Institute, Aubrey creates and investigates ways for people to step toward that long-term vision, together. Her favorite workdays feature learning, writing, and collaborating-especially on walk and talk meetings, with colleagues from near and far, up and down rocky prairie hillsides. This event is presented in partnership with the Mary Riepma Ross Media Arts Center at the University of Nebraska.DocumentaryStatus: CONFIRMED | - |",

Kindly antiques dealer Jess Gris (Federico Luppi) happens upon an ancient golden device in the shape of a scarab, and soon finds himself the possessor and victim of its sinister, addictive powers, as well as the target of a mysterious American named Angel (a delightfully crude and deranged Ron Perlman).

The rarely screened Four Nights of a Dreamer is Robert Bresson's great forgotten masterpiece, a stark yet haunting ode to romantic idealism and the capriciousness of love. Adapted from Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"White Nights,\" Four Nights follows Jacques (Guillaume des Forts), a lonely artist who roams bohemian Paris in search of the girl of his dreams. One night he saves a beautiful young woman, Marthe, from plunging into the Seine in despair over her rejection by an avoidant lover (Maurice Monnoyer). Jacques compassionately attempts to reunite Marthe with her beau, but his feelings for his new friend soon become less than platonic and his investment in her personal drama far from selfless. Four Nights of a Dreamer has been called the French master's \"loveliest\" work: with his signature minimalism, Bresson films the shimmering beauty of nocturnal Paris as it enfolds his characters in endless possibility-subtly capturing the wonder of unexpected connection and the mystery of fate.

      "description": "Deadric Williams, PhD, will join us for our April Grand Rounds to discuss \"Systemic Racism and the Three M's of Racial Inequality: Implications for Health Disparities.\" Dr. Williams is an Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Increased attention has been given to structural racism as a central mechanism perpetuating health disparities in the United States. Dr. Williams builds on this emerging research by proposing a new conceptual model for studying Black-White inequality: The Three M's (The Making, Manifestation, and Maintenance) of Racial Inequality. His key argument is that the creation of socio-historical and political categories-specifically \"race\" -set in motion a mutually sustaining process of structural anti-Blackness and the preservation of Whiteness. These forces operate like interlocking gears that ensure the persistence of racial inequality. In this talk, Dr. Williams will focus on the four mechanisms that function as the metaphorical lubricant that ensures the gears spin perpetually. This entire process is shrouded in racial mystification that makes these socio-historical and political constructs (i.e., racial categories) and racial health disparities seem natural and inevitable.

In one of those wonderful coincidences of history, lumire, the French word for \"light,\" was also the last name of brothers Auguste and Louis, whose brilliant invention, the cinematograph, helped to inaugurate the most beloved art form of the last 130 years. Institute Lumire director Thierry Frmaux uses Lumire, Le Cinema! to guide the viewer through over a hundred shorts-some famous, some forgotten, some never before seen-directed by Lumire and company. In the process, Frmaux illuminates how the brothers employed the camera as a creative instrument as they (and their operators) mastered framing, staging, and subject selection for quotidian and exotic microdocumentaries as well as the first ever fictional motion pictures. The result is not only a glorious re(telling) of the genesis of cinema but a profound meditation on the beautiful world captured-and the mysterious world imagined-by the Lumires.

The Metropolitan Opera's 2025-26 Live in HD season comes to a close with a live transmission of American composer Gabriela Lena Frank's first opera, a magical-realist portrait of Mexico's painterly power couple Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, with libretto by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Nilo Cruz. Fashioned as a reversal of the Orpheus and Euridice myth, the story depicts Frida, sung by leading mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard, leaving the underworld on the Day of the Dead and reuniting with Diego, portrayed by baritone Carlos lvarez. The famously feuding pair briefly relive their tumultuous love, embracing both the passion and the pain before bidding the land of the living a final farewell. Music Director Yannick Nzet-Sguin conducts the Met-premiere staging of Frank's opera, a \"confident, richly imagined score\" (The New Yorker) that \"bursts with color and fresh individuality\" (Los Angeles Times). The vibrant new production, taking enthusiastic inspiration from Frida and Diego's paintings, is directed and choreographed by Deborah Colker. Ross EventStatus: CONFIRMED | |",

The Metropolitan Opera's 2025-26 Live in HD season comes to a close with a live transmission of American composer Gabriela Lena Frank's first opera, a magical-realist portrait of Mexico's painterly power couple Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, with libretto by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Nilo Cruz. Fashioned as a reversal of the Orpheus and Euridice myth, the story depicts Frida, sung by leading mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard, leaving the underworld on the Day of the Dead and reuniting with Diego, portrayed by baritone Carlos lvarez. The famously feuding pair briefly relive their tumultuous love, embracing both the passion and the pain before bidding the land of the living a final farewell. Music Director Yannick Nzet-Sguin conducts the Met-premiere staging of Frank's opera, a \"confident, richly imagined score\" (The New Yorker) that \"bursts with color and fresh individuality\" (Los Angeles Times). The vibrant new production, taking enthusiastic inspiration from Frida and Diego's paintings, is directed and choreographed by Deborah Colker. Ross EventStatus: CONFIRMED | |",

The workshop provides learning opportunities in the form of discussions, design studio explorations and video presentations. The central focus of the workshop is a design studio where students explore design issues and nurture creative energies.

Who Can Participate? Students who have completed two or more years of their high school education and have an interest in architecture, landscape architecture or interior design are encouraged to apply to the workshop. You do not need courses in art or drafting in order to participate. We have reserved space for 36 students the workshop, so register early. How Much Will It Cost?
