This tour is free and open to everyone. Space is limited; registration is encouraged. \"In the Studio\" Whether a pristine, laboratory like space for artistic experimentation, a place of creative chaos, or a bustling hub of social exchange, the space where an artist works is inevitably linked to their processes and the resulting creative output. An artist's decision to showcase their studio in their work is often synonymous with creating a self portrait, whether in a literal or metaphorical sense. \"Diasporas\" Whether forced or voluntary, the movement of people prompts the dispersal and exchange of ideas as well as visual forms. Modern art was profoundly shaped by nineteenth- and twentieth century migrations between countries and continents. This gallery celebrates artists from various diasporas who made work in the United States. About Magdalena Moskalewicz Magdalena Moskalewicz, PhD, is chief curator and associate director for curatorial affairs at the Sheldon Museum of Art. She is an art historian, curator, and author specializing in late modernism, neo-avant-gardes, and contemporary art in a global context. Moskalewicz's work engages in revisionist rewriting of art histories; her exhibitions, publications, and collaborations with living artists critically investigate particular histories, localities, and identities with the goal of reshaping dominant narratives. Born in Warsaw, Poland, she has worked at collecting, exhibiting, and academic institutions internationally, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the 56th Venice Biennale, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and FRONT International in Cleveland.

Dr. Checco grew up in the Twin Cities, Minnesota and obtained his B.A. in Chemistry and Mathematics from St. Olaf College in 2010, and played clarinet in the St. Olaf Band. Checco received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2015 under the mentorship of Sam Gellman, where his research focused on developing methods to inhibit protein-protein interactions using non-natural peptide \"foldamers\". After completing his Ph.D., Checco was a Beckman Institute Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the mentorship of Jonathan Sweedler, where he studied the molecular functions of neuropeptides. In 2019, Checco joined the Chemistry faculty at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where his lab studies the molecular details of cell-to-cell communication by endogenous peptides. The ultimate goals of this research are both to understand fundamental processes in cellular communication and to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention. The Checco lab has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and industry. Checco's work has been recognized by a number of awards, including a COBRE Rising Star Award and an International Chemical Biology Society Young Chemical Biologist Award.

The Great Plains Art Museum's extensive collection of Kirsch's work spans his time teaching in Nebraska through his last years at the Colorado State Veterans Nursing Home.

About the Genoa Indian Industrial School In operation from 1884 through 1934, the Indian Industrial School at Genoa was the fourth largest non-reservation boarding school established by the United States Office of Indian Affairs. The village of Genoa, Nebraska was selected because the US federal government already owned the former Pawnee Reservation property there. The facility's mission was to educate Native American children to assimilate them into American society. The students at Genoa Indian School were from more than ten states and over 40 different tribal nations.

Many of the country's most divisive issues - such as gender, sexuality, and race - are deeply intertwined with people's religious beliefs. As a result, the moral reasoning embedded in certain legal discussions often reflects the intersection of biblically based ideas and public policy. In this lecture, Dr. Joel Kemp examines how the 2023 SFFA decision continues this trend of drawing on biblical concepts to articulate legal conclusions.

After a tender courtship, he marries Gladys (Academy Award-nominee Felicity Jones) and they build a home together, though his work often takes him far from her and their young daughter. When his life takes an unexpected turn, Robert finds beauty, brutality and newfound meaning for the forests and trees he has felled.Ross MovieStatus: CONFIRMED | |", "group": "Ross Movie", "image_url": "https://events.unl.edu/?image&id=171622", "audience": ["Alumni", "Faculty", "Graduate Students", "Postdoctoral", "Prospective Students", "Public", "Staff", "Undergraduate Students"], "source": "https://events.unl.edu/upcoming/?format=rss&limit=-1"}, {"title": "Battle of the Food Scientists", "url": "https://events.unl.edu/2026/03/12/198007/", "start": "2026-03-12T04:00:00-05:00", "end": "2026-03-12T20:00:00-05:00", "location": "8:00: pm", "description": "Phi Tau Sigma (UNL) invites you to the Battle of Food Scientists on Thursday, March 12, 2026 (4:00-8:00 PM) at the Food Innovation Center.

This talk examines how generative AI can be systematically integrated into educational media to support learning, reflection, and adaptive feedback without displacing pedagogical intent or learner agency. Drawing on design-based research and learning sciences perspectives, the talk introduces a design-oriented framework for generative AI-enhanced educational media that foregrounds (1) pedagogical alignment, (2) learner-AI interaction dynamics, and (3) evidence-centered learning analytics. Through examples from AI-mediated simulations, intelligent digital textbooks, and game-based learning environments, the talk illustrates how generative AI can function as a co-designer, adaptive scaffold, and analytic lens rather than a content replacement engine. Particular attention is given to how generative models can support formative feedback, reflective sense-making, and personalization while maintaining transparency, equity, and interpretability. The talk concludes by outlining design tensions, ethical considerations, and research directions for advancing generative AI as a robust educational media infrastructure rather than a standalone instructional technology.

You’ll have some great conversations with new friends as you paddle in the tight canyons forged by iconic watersheds of the remote desert and explore side canyons or remains of villages. Find something worth telling stories about when you return from break. Given the remoteness and challenging rapids of this trip, this trip will require participants to be actively involved in paddling and learning how to navigate the rapids. This trip is an opportunity to work through challenges as a team and do significant physical exercise over spring break.

Heroic tenor Michael Spyres stars opposite Davidsen as the love-drunk Tristan. The momentous occasion also marks the advent of a new, Met-debut staging by Yuval Sharon-hailed by The New York Times as \"the most visionary opera director of his generation\" and the first American to direct an opera at the famed Wagner festival in Bayreuth-as well as Music Director Yannick Nzet-Sguin's first time leading Tristan und Isolde at the Met. Mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Gubanova reprises her portrayal of Brangne, alongside bass-baritone Tomasz Konieczny, who sings Kurwenal after celebrated Met appearances in Wagner's Der Fliegende Hollnder and Ring cycle. Bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green makes an important role debut as King Marke.

Heroic tenor Michael Spyres stars opposite Davidsen as the love-drunk Tristan. The momentous occasion also marks the advent of a new, Met-debut staging by Yuval Sharon-hailed by The New York Times as \"the most visionary opera director of his generation\" and the first American to direct an opera at the famed Wagner festival in Bayreuth-as well as Music Director Yannick Nzet-Sguin's first time leading Tristan und Isolde at the Met.

Growing up under the poverty line and witnessing firsthand the barriers to technical education, Danielle created the SkoBots, wearable, personal language-learning robots to teach Anishinaabemowin. Built with affordability, sustainability, and cultural relevance in mind, her robots cost less than $100 to produce and are distributed free to Indigenous youth. Danielle shares how she has reached over one million students globally, disbursed tens of thousands of robots, and built a movement rooted in community, grassroots innovation, and intergenerational knowledge. J.S. Onsimo (Ness) Sndoval, \"Demography as an Analytic Lens: Latino Population Growth and the Demographic Transformation of the Midwest\" This talk explores how Latino population growth is reshaping the social, economic, and political landscape of the Midwest. By examining historical settlement patterns, contemporary demographic shifts, and projected trends, it highlights how Latindad has become an essential force driving regional transformation. Using demography as an analytic lens, the presentation connects statistical evidence with lived experience to reveal the far-reaching economic and political consequences of demographic change showing how Latino are redefining the future of Midwestern identity, governance, and opportunity. Shaylyn Romney Garrett, \"America's Upswing\" Co-hosted with the E.N. Thompson Forum on World Issues at the Lied Center for Performing Arts. Separate (free) tickets required. Social entrepreneur and coauthor of \"The Upswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It Again,\" Garrett has shared her opinions, writing, and research in numerous outlets including TIME Magazine, The New York Times, National Public Radio, BBC Radio, and the PBS Newshour. Her nonprofit work has been featured by the New York Times, FastCompany, LinkedIn, and Harvard Business Review. Neil Linscheid, \"Community Usability: Designing Communities for People (And Not the Other Way Around)\" What makes a community truly work for the people who live there? Across the Midwest and beyond, communities are moving past simply collecting data about newcomers, residents, and entrepreneurs. They're using that information to fundamentally redesign how their towns and cities function. This talk examines what's working, what's not, and what we can learn from communities that are getting it right. We'll look at communities that have reimagined how newcomers access essential services, how entrepreneurs navigate local systems, and how long-time residents connect with changing resources. We'll also examine what happens when communities stop designing for an idealized resident and start designing for the real, diverse people already there. Carol Graham, \"Success in Conservation; Partnering with Producers and Private Landowners\" Manitoba Habitat Conservancy (MHC) has been delivering conservation programs on private lands across southern Manitoba for 40 years. Enhancing habitat for species at risk and managing wetlands for waterfowl has required partnerships with producers, landowners, and industry. An emphasis on a collaborative approach has resulted in successful securement, enhancement, and mitigation of wildlife habitats in Manitoba. This community approach not only maintains ecological integrity and promotes biodiversity but also ensures ecosystem resilience and long-term ecological stability, beneficial for both producers and private landowners. Graham will speak about lessons learned and successes achieved over the years with programs that target native grassland management for wildlife and livestock production, upland enhancement for nesting habitats, and wetland retention and restoration for waterfowl.

An inhabitant of Algaraba, a colony of Earth in a parallel universe, Cenex struggles to find a name, a body, and a stable home. The song of Cenex weaves and clashes texts by cis writers on trans figures with fragments from historical, legal, and other nonliterary texts. Cenex leads us through his childhood hospitalization, his years as an experimental subject, a brief stay in suburbia, twisted meanderings, and not-so-far-off lands accompanied by a merry band of chosen queers. Referencing everything from pop culture to Taino cosmology and philosophy (at times in a single line), this book laughs at its own survival with sharp, unserious rage. The edition is composed of two original texts-one written in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish, the other in a reconsideration of English. \"Algaraba\" inscribes an origin narrative for trans people in the face of their erasure from both colonial and anti-colonial literary canons. Algaraba es una epopeya que sigue el viaje de Cenex, un ser trans que narra su vida retrospectivamente mientras navega por las historias contadas en su nombre. Habitante de Algaraba, una colonia de la Tierra en un universo paralelo, Cenex lucha por encontrar un nombre, un cuerpo y un hogar estables. El canto de Cenex entreteje y enfrenta textos de escritores cis sobre figuras trans con fragmentos de textos histricos, documentos legales y otras fuentes extraliterarias. Su protagonista nos conduce a travs de su hospitalizacin temprana, sus aos como sujeto experimental, una breve estancia suburbana, meandros retorcidos y unas tierras no tan lejanas en la compaa de un grupo jovial de cuirs predilectos. Poblado de referencias a la cultura popular, la cosmologa tana y la filosofa (a veces dentro de un mismo verso), este libro se re de su propia supervivencia con una rabia pcara y aguda. La epopeya se compone de dos textos originales: uno que fue escrito en espaol puertorriqueo y el otro que fue escrito en un ingls alterado. Algaraba inscribe un origen para las personas trans ante su exclusin de los cnones literarios coloniales y anticoloniales.

Returning to cinemas for the first time in over a decade, Helen Mirren plays Queen Elizabeth II in the Olivier and Tony Award(R) -winning hit production, directed by Stephen Daldry. For 60 years, Queen Elizabeth II met with each of her 12 prime ministers in a private weekly meeting. This meeting is known as The Audience. From Winston Churchill to Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron, the Queen advised her prime ministers on matters both public and personal. Through these private audiences, we see glimpses of the woman behind the crown and witness the moments that shaped a monarch.

Growing up under the poverty line and witnessing firsthand the barriers to technical education, Danielle created the SkoBots, wearable, personal language-learning robots to teach Anishinaabemowin. Built with affordability, sustainability, and cultural relevance in mind, her robots cost less than $100 to produce and are distributed free to Indigenous youth. Danielle shares how she has reached over one million students globally, disbursed tens of thousands of robots, and built a movement rooted in community, grassroots innovation, and intergenerational knowledge. J.S. Onsimo (Ness) Sndoval, \"Demography as an Analytic Lens: Latino Population Growth and the Demographic Transformation of the Midwest\" This talk explores how Latino population growth is reshaping the social, economic, and political landscape of the Midwest. By examining historical settlement patterns, contemporary demographic shifts, and projected trends, it highlights how Latindad has become an essential force driving regional transformation. Using demography as an analytic lens, the presentation connects statistical evidence with lived experience to reveal the far-reaching economic and political consequences of demographic change showing how Latino are redefining the future of Midwestern identity, governance, and opportunity.

Her nonprofit work has been featured by the New York Times, FastCompany, LinkedIn, and Harvard Business Review. Neil Linscheid, \"Community Usability: Designing Communities for People (And Not the Other Way Around)\" What makes a community truly work for the people who live there? Across the Midwest and beyond, communities are moving past simply collecting data about newcomers, residents, and entrepreneurs. They're using that information to fundamentally redesign how their towns and cities function. This talk examines what's working, what's not, and what we can learn from communities that are getting it right. We'll look at communities that have reimagined how newcomers access essential services, how entrepreneurs navigate local systems, and how long-time residents connect with changing resources. We'll also examine what happens when communities stop designing for an idealized resident and start designing for the real, diverse people already there. Carol Graham, \"Success in Conservation; Partnering with Producers and Private Landowners\" Manitoba Habitat Conservancy (MHC) has been delivering conservation programs on private lands across southern Manitoba for 40 years. Enhancing habitat for species at risk and managing wetlands for waterfowl has required partnerships with producers, landowners, and industry. An emphasis on a collaborative approach has resulted in successful securement, enhancement, and mitigation of wildlife habitats in Manitoba. This community approach not only maintains ecological integrity and promotes biodiversity but also ensures ecosystem resilience and long-term ecological stability, beneficial for both producers and private landowners. Graham will speak about lessons learned and successes achieved over the years with programs that target native grassland management for wildlife and livestock production, upland enhancement for nesting habitats, and wetland retention and restoration for waterfowl.

For 60 years, Queen Elizabeth II met with each of her 12 prime ministers in a private weekly meeting. This meeting is known as The Audience. From Winston Churchill to Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron, the Queen advised her prime ministers on matters both public and personal.

In this lecture, Olivia Weisser, Associate Professor of History at the University of Massachusetts Boston, explores London between 1650 and 1750 through the unexpected lens of a shameful sexually transmitted disease. While venereal disease was widespread, the lived experiences of those who carried it have often been hidden from history. Moving beyond medical institutions and learned texts, the talk follows patients into the streets, shops, and homes where treatment was sought and sold. Drawing on more than 700 advertisements for cures, it reveals a bustling underground marketplace in which pills and potions were offered not only by healers, but discreetly by bakers, grocers, and other everyday retailers-foreshadowing a booming proprietary drug trade far earlier than historians once believed.The Dreaded Pox: Sex and Disease in Early Modern LondonStatus: CONFIRMED | |", "group": "Sex and Disease in Early Modern London", "image_url": "https://events.unl.edu/?image&id=171299", "audience": ["Alumni", "Faculty", "Graduate Students", "Postdoctoral", "Prospective Students", "Public", "Staff", "Undergraduate Students"], "source": "https://events.unl.edu/upcoming/?format=rss&limit=-1"}, {"title": "Capital City", "url": "https://events.unl.edu/2026/04/09/190528/", "start": "2026-04-09T19:30:00-05:00", "end": null, "location": "Lied Center for Performing Arts Room:Carson Theater", "description": "Money.

Ever wondered how astronauts enjoy tasty meals in space or how hikers pack lightweight, flavorful food for long adventures? The secret is freeze drying – a fascinating process that locks in taste, texture, and nutrition while removing moisture. Unlike traditional drying, freeze drying uses low temperatures and a vacuum to turn ice straight into water vapor, leading to minimal heat damage and nutrient loss! From fruits and veggies to full meals, freeze drying makes food shelf-stable, easy to store, and simple to rehydrate. Whether you’re prepping for emergencies, planning your next camping trip, or just curious about food science, this workshop will show you why freeze drying is the ultimate preservation technique.WORKSHOPStatus: CONFIRMED | |", "group": "WORKSHOP", "image_url": "https://events.unl.edu/?image&id=169993", "audience": ["Alumni", "Faculty", "Graduate Students", "Postdoctoral", "Prospective Students", "Public", "Staff", "Undergraduate Students"], "source": "https://events.unl.edu/upcoming/?format=rss&limit=-1"}, {"title": "Capital City", "url": "https://events.unl.edu/2026/04/12/190527/", "start": "2026-04-12T13:30:00-05:00", "end": null, "location": "Lied Center for Performing Arts Room:Carson Theater", "description": "Money.

With his senses-ravishing third feature, visionary director Bi Gan takes his deepest plunge yet into the realm of pure cinematic dreamscape. In a world where humans have forsaken dreams in exchange for immortality, a dreaming monster (Jackson Yee) embarks on a shape-shifting odyssey through illusion, beauty, and terror that takes him across the twentieth century and to the end of time. Unfolding in five dazzlingly imagined chapters that encompass everything from silent-cinema expressionism to film noir to a delirious vampire love story shot in one of Bi's signature long takes, Resurrection is a work of breathtaking imagination in which cinema is the ultimate portal to the unconscious mind.

A MacArthur \"Genius\" Grant and Right Livelihood Award recipient, Jackson has been lauded by the Smithsonian, The Atlantic and The New York Times, among many others, and named \"One of the 18 most important Americans of the 20th Century.\" Jackson co-founded The Land Institute, also in its 50th year, as a nonprofit educational organization exploring sustainable alternatives in agriculture, energy, shelter, and waste disposal. In addition to being a scientist and geneticist who has focused on agriculture, Jackson is also a philosopher, educator, author, and organizer. He has spent his life seeking solutions through innovative thought and multi-disciplinary approaches, inspiring others to mimic the wisdom inherent in ecosystems. See the trailer at: https://www.prairieprophecy.com Aubrey Streit Krug grew up in rural Kansas, where her parents farm wheat and raise cattle, and her curiosity about prairie stories and plants led her to earn a PhD in English and Great Plains Studies. Aubrey is drawn to the possibility of more just human communities grounded in place and nourished by diverse, perennial food systems. At The Land Institute, Aubrey creates and investigates ways for people to step toward that long-term vision, together. Her favorite workdays feature learning, writing, and collaborating-especially on walk and talk meetings, with colleagues from near and far, up and down rocky prairie hillsides.

The rarely screened Four Nights of a Dreamer is Robert Bresson's great forgotten masterpiece, a stark yet haunting ode to romantic idealism and the capriciousness of love. Adapted from Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"White Nights,\" Four Nights follows Jacques (Guillaume des Forts), a lonely artist who roams bohemian Paris in search of the girl of his dreams. One night he saves a beautiful young woman, Marthe, from plunging into the Seine in despair over her rejection by an avoidant lover (Maurice Monnoyer). Jacques compassionately attempts to reunite Marthe with her beau, but his feelings for his new friend soon become less than platonic and his investment in her personal drama far from selfless. Four Nights of a Dreamer has been called the French master's \"loveliest\" work: with his signature minimalism, Bresson films the shimmering beauty of nocturnal Paris as it enfolds his characters in endless possibility-subtly capturing the wonder of unexpected connection and the mystery of fate.

Increased attention has been given to structural racism as a central mechanism perpetuating health disparities in the United States. Dr. Williams builds on this emerging research by proposing a new conceptual model for studying Black-White inequality: The Three M's (The Making, Manifestation, and Maintenance) of Racial Inequality. His key argument is that the creation of socio-historical and political categories-specifically \"race\" -set in motion a mutually sustaining process of structural anti-Blackness and the preservation of Whiteness. These forces operate like interlocking gears that ensure the persistence of racial inequality. In this talk, Dr. Williams will focus on the four mechanisms that function as the metaphorical lubricant that ensures the gears spin perpetually. This entire process is shrouded in racial mystification that makes these socio-historical and political constructs (i.e., racial categories) and racial health disparities seem natural and inevitable.

In one of those wonderful coincidences of history, lumire, the French word for \"light,\" was also the last name of brothers Auguste and Louis, whose brilliant invention, the cinematograph, helped to inaugurate the most beloved art form of the last 130 years. Institute Lumire director Thierry Frmaux uses Lumire, Le Cinema! to guide the viewer through over a hundred shorts-some famous, some forgotten, some never before seen-directed by Lumire and company. In the process, Frmaux illuminates how the brothers employed the camera as a creative instrument as they (and their operators) mastered framing, staging, and subject selection for quotidian and exotic microdocumentaries as well as the first ever fictional motion pictures. The result is not only a glorious re(telling) of the genesis of cinema but a profound meditation on the beautiful world captured-and the mysterious world imagined-by the Lumires.

The Metropolitan Opera's 2025-26 Live in HD season comes to a close with a live transmission of American composer Gabriela Lena Frank's first opera, a magical-realist portrait of Mexico's painterly power couple Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, with libretto by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Nilo Cruz. Fashioned as a reversal of the Orpheus and Euridice myth, the story depicts Frida, sung by leading mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard, leaving the underworld on the Day of the Dead and reuniting with Diego, portrayed by baritone Carlos lvarez. The famously feuding pair briefly relive their tumultuous love, embracing both the passion and the pain before bidding the land of the living a final farewell. Music Director Yannick Nzet-Sguin conducts the Met-premiere staging of Frank's opera, a \"confident, richly imagined score\" (The New Yorker) that \"bursts with color and fresh individuality\" (Los Angeles Times). The vibrant new production, taking enthusiastic inspiration from Frida and Diego's paintings, is directed and choreographed by Deborah Colker.

The Metropolitan Opera's 2025-26 Live in HD season comes to a close with a live transmission of American composer Gabriela Lena Frank's first opera, a magical-realist portrait of Mexico's painterly power couple Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, with libretto by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Nilo Cruz. Fashioned as a reversal of the Orpheus and Euridice myth, the story depicts Frida, sung by leading mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard, leaving the underworld on the Day of the Dead and reuniting with Diego, portrayed by baritone Carlos lvarez. The famously feuding pair briefly relive their tumultuous love, embracing both the passion and the pain before bidding the land of the living a final farewell. Music Director Yannick Nzet-Sguin conducts the Met-premiere staging of Frank's opera, a \"confident, richly imagined score\" (The New Yorker) that \"bursts with color and fresh individuality\" (Los Angeles Times). The vibrant new production, taking enthusiastic inspiration from Frida and Diego's paintings, is directed and choreographed by Deborah Colker.

Filmed live on stage at the National Theatre, Marianne Elliott (Angels in America) directs this thrilling game of love, lies, and social warfare.Ross EventStatus: CONFIRMED | |", "group": "Ross Event", "image_url": "https://events.unl.edu/?image&id=171631", "audience": ["Alumni", "Faculty", "Graduate Students", "Postdoctoral", "Prospective Students", "Public", "Staff", "Undergraduate Students"], "source": "https://events.unl.edu/upcoming/?format=rss&limit=-1"}, {"title": "Independence Day", "url": "https://events.unl.edu/2026/07/03/145778/", "start": "2026-07-03T00:00:00-05:00", "end": null, "location": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln Room:", "description": "National HolidayUniversity ClosedStatus: CONFIRMED | |", "group": "National HolidayUniversity Closed", "image_url": "https://events.unl.edu/?image&id=116931", "audience": ["Faculty", "Staff"], "source": "https://events.unl.edu/upcoming/?format=rss&limit=-1"}, {"title": "Returning Student Move-in Timeslots Close", "url": "https://events.unl.edu/2026/07/07/196208/", "start": "2026-07-07T09:30:00-05:00", "end": null, "location": "9:30: am", "description": "July 7 is the last day for returning, transfer, and graduate students to select a move-in timeslot for fall 2026.Status: CONFIRMED |", "group": "Housing & Dining", "image_url": null, "audience": ["Graduate Students", "Undergraduate Students"], "source": "https://events.unl.edu/upcoming/?format=rss&limit=-1"}, {"title": "New Employee Orientation", "url": "https://events.unl.edu/2026/07/08/171726/", "start": "2026-07-08T08:30:00-05:00", "end": "2026-07-08T12:00:00-05:00", "location": "12:00: pm", "description": "You will receive valuable insights and resources during your orientation. • Get acquainted with the vibrant community and inclusive culture at the university. • Connect with fellow new employees from various departments across campus and engage in meaningful conversations. • Dive into our strategic plan and explore how it aligns with your role and goals within the university. • Gain valuable insights from a senior leader who will share their experiences and vision for the university’s future.

Comprehensive, challenging exercise is only one of the many benefits of karate practice. Teaching traditional karate-do as a serious art and way of life means much more. It ensures the original ideas of the founder are passed on to our students, so that we grow in all aspects of our lives. Altman Senpai pushes us to challenge ourselves and taste our life, to be more fully aware and conscientious at all times. Our karate practice can be very difficult. The main difficulty lies in training one's mind to be disciplined and focused. Remember, anyone can be lazy, because that is the easiest thing to do! Karate may be defined as a weapon-less means of self-defense. These techniques use all parts of the body to their maximum advantage. Our fundamental techniques are divided into three main aspects: - Kihon — Fundamental blocks, punches, kicks, and stances- Kata — Pre-arranged forms simulating combat situations- Kumite — Sparring In each category, the beginner is given instruction at the most basic level until the techniques become spontaneous to them. As the student progresses technically, the practice progresses physically and the student begins to build greater stamina. At this stage, one involves himself or herself with the more intricate and difficult kata and more dynamic forms of kumite. Karate as self-defense is one of the most dynamic of all the martial arts. The trained karate student is able to coordinate the mind and body perfectly, thereby allowing one to unleash tremendous physical power at will. It is not the possession of great physical strength that makes a strong karateka; rather it is the ability to coordinate the mind and body. Upon developing this ability, even the smallest person finds that within themselves is the power to deliver a devastating blow to any would-be attacker. The values of karate to modern life are numerous. In our everyday lives we often forget the value of exercise to both our physical and mental health. The practice of karate tones the body, develops coordination, quickens reflexes, and builds stamina. Also, the serious practice of karate develops composure, a clearer thought process, deeper insight into one's mental capabilities, and more self-confidence. In this, karate is not an end, but a means to an end. It is an activity in which advancing age is not a hindrance. Rather, it encourages proficiency and the keen coordination of mind and body.", "group": "Shotokan Karate of America Club", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/e3168f30-f857-48be-b1a6-7535a4169081145e546d-254a-4c3c-ab99-f9e06ba651c2.png", "audience": ["Rehearsal or Practice"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "Kappa Delta Chi Meeting", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/12253989", "start": "2026-03-03T23:45:00+00:00", "end": "2026-03-04T04:00:00+00:00", "location": "City Campus Union", "description": "A meeting for the members and new members of Kappa Delta Chi", "group": "Kappa Delta Chi", "image_url": null, "audience": null, "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "Engineering Student Advisory Board (eSAB) General Meeting", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/11429010", "start": "2026-03-04T00:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-03-04T01:00:00+00:00", "location": "Kiewit Hall A203", "description": "Members of the board meet in alternating cycles of general and committee meetings.

The main difficulty lies in training one's mind to be disciplined and focused. Remember, anyone can be lazy, because that is the easiest thing to do! Karate may be defined as a weapon-less means of self-defense. These techniques use all parts of the body to their maximum advantage. Our fundamental techniques are divided into three main aspects: - Kihon — Fundamental blocks, punches, kicks, and stances- Kata — Pre-arranged forms simulating combat situations- Kumite — Sparring In each category, the beginner is given instruction at the most basic level until the techniques become spontaneous to them. As the student progresses technically, the practice progresses physically and the student begins to build greater stamina. At this stage, one involves himself or herself with the more intricate and difficult kata and more dynamic forms of kumite. Karate as self-defense is one of the most dynamic of all the martial arts. The trained karate student is able to coordinate the mind and body perfectly, thereby allowing one to unleash tremendous physical power at will. It is not the possession of great physical strength that makes a strong karateka; rather it is the ability to coordinate the mind and body. Upon developing this ability, even the smallest person finds that within themselves is the power to deliver a devastating blow to any would-be attacker. The values of karate to modern life are numerous. In our everyday lives we often forget the value of exercise to both our physical and mental health. The practice of karate tones the body, develops coordination, quickens reflexes, and builds stamina. Also, the serious practice of karate develops composure, a clearer thought process, deeper insight into one's mental capabilities, and more self-confidence. In this, karate is not an end, but a means to an end. It is an activity in which advancing age is not a hindrance.

Comprehensive, challenging exercise is only one of the many benefits of karate practice. Teaching traditional karate-do as a serious art and way of life means much more. It ensures the original ideas of the founder are passed on to our students, so that we grow in all aspects of our lives. Altman Senpai pushes us to challenge ourselves and taste our life, to be more fully aware and conscientious at all times. Our karate practice can be very difficult. The main difficulty lies in training one's mind to be disciplined and focused. Remember, anyone can be lazy, because that is the easiest thing to do! Karate may be defined as a weapon-less means of self-defense. These techniques use all parts of the body to their maximum advantage. Our fundamental techniques are divided into three main aspects: - Kihon — Fundamental blocks, punches, kicks, and stances- Kata — Pre-arranged forms simulating combat situations- Kumite — Sparring In each category, the beginner is given instruction at the most basic level until the techniques become spontaneous to them. As the student progresses technically, the practice progresses physically and the student begins to build greater stamina. At this stage, one involves himself or herself with the more intricate and difficult kata and more dynamic forms of kumite. Karate as self-defense is one of the most dynamic of all the martial arts. The trained karate student is able to coordinate the mind and body perfectly, thereby allowing one to unleash tremendous physical power at will. It is not the possession of great physical strength that makes a strong karateka; rather it is the ability to coordinate the mind and body. Upon developing this ability, even the smallest person finds that within themselves is the power to deliver a devastating blow to any would-be attacker. The values of karate to modern life are numerous. In our everyday lives we often forget the value of exercise to both our physical and mental health. The practice of karate tones the body, develops coordination, quickens reflexes, and builds stamina. Also, the serious practice of karate develops composure, a clearer thought process, deeper insight into one's mental capabilities, and more self-confidence. In this, karate is not an end, but a means to an end. It is an activity in which advancing age is not a hindrance. Rather, it encourages proficiency and the keen coordination of mind and body.", "group": "Shotokan Karate of America Club", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/e3168f30-f857-48be-b1a6-7535a4169081145e546d-254a-4c3c-ab99-f9e06ba651c2.png", "audience": ["Rehearsal or Practice"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "BRIC Stock Pitch", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/11982490", "start": "2026-03-24T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-03-25T00:00:00+00:00", "location": "HLH 104 (trading room)", "description": "BRIC Stock Pitch Session", "group": "Big Red Investment Club", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/b45bd708-d1fb-48cc-988d-316f6ca7fe72fd827741-8e97-4401-a533-7fd5350a7dfe.png", "audience": ["Meeting"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "Weekly Meeting", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/12028132", "start": "2026-03-24T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-03-25T00:00:00+00:00", "location": "City Union", "description": "A weekly meeting where we discuss current events, conservative values and ideas, and plan activism campaigns", "group": "Young Americans for Freedom", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/9413d189-0ac0-4ec7-b4f5-b99e44a96d4278097369-e424-4577-b18d-7314cb28b585.png", "audience": ["Meeting"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "General Meeting", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/12048579", "start": "2026-03-24T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-03-25T00:00:00+00:00", "location": "Nebraska Union", "description": "UNL Feminism Club General Meeting", "group": "UNL Feminism Club", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/5224226d-d2e2-453e-93db-0c9e1c4aee601cbab781-46c0-4cb0-9c5d-52cb831402ff.png", "audience": ["Husker POWER - Purpose", "Husker POWER - Ownership", "Husker POWER - Well-Being", "Husker POWER - Engagement", "Husker POWER - Relationships"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "Engineering Student Advisory Board (eSAB) General Meeting", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/11429013", "start": "2026-03-24T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-03-25T00:00:00+00:00", "location": "Kiewit Hall A203", "description": "Members of the board meet in alternating cycles of general and committee meetings.

Comprehensive, challenging exercise is only one of the many benefits of karate practice. Teaching traditional karate-do as a serious art and way of life means much more. It ensures the original ideas of the founder are passed on to our students, so that we grow in all aspects of our lives. Altman Senpai pushes us to challenge ourselves and taste our life, to be more fully aware and conscientious at all times. Our karate practice can be very difficult. The main difficulty lies in training one's mind to be disciplined and focused. Remember, anyone can be lazy, because that is the easiest thing to do! Karate may be defined as a weapon-less means of self-defense. These techniques use all parts of the body to their maximum advantage. Our fundamental techniques are divided into three main aspects: - Kihon — Fundamental blocks, punches, kicks, and stances- Kata — Pre-arranged forms simulating combat situations- Kumite — Sparring In each category, the beginner is given instruction at the most basic level until the techniques become spontaneous to them. As the student progresses technically, the practice progresses physically and the student begins to build greater stamina. At this stage, one involves himself or herself with the more intricate and difficult kata and more dynamic forms of kumite. Karate as self-defense is one of the most dynamic of all the martial arts. The trained karate student is able to coordinate the mind and body perfectly, thereby allowing one to unleash tremendous physical power at will. It is not the possession of great physical strength that makes a strong karateka; rather it is the ability to coordinate the mind and body. Upon developing this ability, even the smallest person finds that within themselves is the power to deliver a devastating blow to any would-be attacker. The values of karate to modern life are numerous. In our everyday lives we often forget the value of exercise to both our physical and mental health. The practice of karate tones the body, develops coordination, quickens reflexes, and builds stamina. Also, the serious practice of karate develops composure, a clearer thought process, deeper insight into one's mental capabilities, and more self-confidence. In this, karate is not an end, but a means to an end. It is an activity in which advancing age is not a hindrance. Rather, it encourages proficiency and the keen coordination of mind and body.", "group": "Shotokan Karate of America Club", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/fb85e20b-cb35-42b3-9db9-c2d5157916e30068319a-298f-41c1-a14b-48f0f75d1a97.png", "audience": ["Rehearsal or Practice"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "BRIC General Meeting", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/11982462", "start": "2026-03-25T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-03-26T00:00:00+00:00", "location": "HLH 010", "description": "General Session Meeting", "group": "Big Red Investment Club", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/547b7489-d740-49d0-af2c-c0c08df3b534cdb1ddfa-8159-4e2a-b286-41e514243110.png", "audience": ["Meeting"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "College Republicans Weekly Meeting", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/11977937", "start": "2026-03-25T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-03-26T00:00:00+00:00", "location": "Nebraska Union", "description": "Come hang out with the College Republicans!

Comprehensive, challenging exercise is only one of the many benefits of karate practice. Teaching traditional karate-do as a serious art and way of life means much more. It ensures the original ideas of the founder are passed on to our students, so that we grow in all aspects of our lives. Altman Senpai pushes us to challenge ourselves and taste our life, to be more fully aware and conscientious at all times. Our karate practice can be very difficult. The main difficulty lies in training one's mind to be disciplined and focused. Remember, anyone can be lazy, because that is the easiest thing to do! Karate may be defined as a weapon-less means of self-defense. These techniques use all parts of the body to their maximum advantage. Our fundamental techniques are divided into three main aspects: - Kihon — Fundamental blocks, punches, kicks, and stances- Kata — Pre-arranged forms simulating combat situations- Kumite — Sparring In each category, the beginner is given instruction at the most basic level until the techniques become spontaneous to them. As the student progresses technically, the practice progresses physically and the student begins to build greater stamina. At this stage, one involves himself or herself with the more intricate and difficult kata and more dynamic forms of kumite. Karate as self-defense is one of the most dynamic of all the martial arts. The trained karate student is able to coordinate the mind and body perfectly, thereby allowing one to unleash tremendous physical power at will. It is not the possession of great physical strength that makes a strong karateka; rather it is the ability to coordinate the mind and body. Upon developing this ability, even the smallest person finds that within themselves is the power to deliver a devastating blow to any would-be attacker. The values of karate to modern life are numerous. In our everyday lives we often forget the value of exercise to both our physical and mental health. The practice of karate tones the body, develops coordination, quickens reflexes, and builds stamina. Also, the serious practice of karate develops composure, a clearer thought process, deeper insight into one's mental capabilities, and more self-confidence. In this, karate is not an end, but a means to an end. It is an activity in which advancing age is not a hindrance. Rather, it encourages proficiency and the keen coordination of mind and body.", "group": "Shotokan Karate of America Club", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/e3168f30-f857-48be-b1a6-7535a4169081145e546d-254a-4c3c-ab99-f9e06ba651c2.png", "audience": ["Rehearsal or Practice"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "Derby Days Volleyball Tournament", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/12294484", "start": "2026-04-14T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-04-15T02:00:00+00:00", "location": "Knoll Volleyball Courts", "description": "This will be to hold our annual Derby Days volleyball tournament.

Comprehensive, challenging exercise is only one of the many benefits of karate practice. Teaching traditional karate-do as a serious art and way of life means much more. It ensures the original ideas of the founder are passed on to our students, so that we grow in all aspects of our lives. Altman Senpai pushes us to challenge ourselves and taste our life, to be more fully aware and conscientious at all times. Our karate practice can be very difficult. The main difficulty lies in training one's mind to be disciplined and focused. Remember, anyone can be lazy, because that is the easiest thing to do! Karate may be defined as a weapon-less means of self-defense. These techniques use all parts of the body to their maximum advantage. Our fundamental techniques are divided into three main aspects: - Kihon — Fundamental blocks, punches, kicks, and stances- Kata — Pre-arranged forms simulating combat situations- Kumite — Sparring In each category, the beginner is given instruction at the most basic level until the techniques become spontaneous to them. As the student progresses technically, the practice progresses physically and the student begins to build greater stamina. At this stage, one involves himself or herself with the more intricate and difficult kata and more dynamic forms of kumite. Karate as self-defense is one of the most dynamic of all the martial arts. The trained karate student is able to coordinate the mind and body perfectly, thereby allowing one to unleash tremendous physical power at will. It is not the possession of great physical strength that makes a strong karateka; rather it is the ability to coordinate the mind and body. Upon developing this ability, even the smallest person finds that within themselves is the power to deliver a devastating blow to any would-be attacker. The values of karate to modern life are numerous. In our everyday lives we often forget the value of exercise to both our physical and mental health. The practice of karate tones the body, develops coordination, quickens reflexes, and builds stamina. Also, the serious practice of karate develops composure, a clearer thought process, deeper insight into one's mental capabilities, and more self-confidence. In this, karate is not an end, but a means to an end. It is an activity in which advancing age is not a hindrance. Rather, it encourages proficiency and the keen coordination of mind and body.", "group": "Shotokan Karate of America Club", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/e3168f30-f857-48be-b1a6-7535a4169081145e546d-254a-4c3c-ab99-f9e06ba651c2.png", "audience": ["Rehearsal or Practice"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "Executive Board Elections", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/12084446", "start": "2026-04-21T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-04-22T00:00:00+00:00", "location": "UNL City Campus Union", "description": "Members will be able to pitch a speech for the positions they would like on our executive board for the next school year, and all members are invited to vote for candidates.", "group": "Pre-Physician Assistant Club of UNL", "image_url": null, "audience": null, "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "BRIC Stock Pitch", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/11982498", "start": "2026-04-21T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-04-22T00:00:00+00:00", "location": "HLH 104 (trading room)", "description": "BRIC Stock Pitch Session", "group": "Big Red Investment Club", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/b45bd708-d1fb-48cc-988d-316f6ca7fe72fd827741-8e97-4401-a533-7fd5350a7dfe.png", "audience": ["Meeting"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "Engineering Student Advisory Board (eSAB) General Meeting", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/11429017", "start": "2026-04-21T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-04-29T00:00:00+00:00", "location": "Kiewit Hall A203", "description": "Members of the board meet in alternating cycles of general and committee meetings.

Comprehensive, challenging exercise is only one of the many benefits of karate practice. Teaching traditional karate-do as a serious art and way of life means much more. It ensures the original ideas of the founder are passed on to our students, so that we grow in all aspects of our lives. Altman Senpai pushes us to challenge ourselves and taste our life, to be more fully aware and conscientious at all times. Our karate practice can be very difficult. The main difficulty lies in training one's mind to be disciplined and focused. Remember, anyone can be lazy, because that is the easiest thing to do! Karate may be defined as a weapon-less means of self-defense. These techniques use all parts of the body to their maximum advantage. Our fundamental techniques are divided into three main aspects: - Kihon — Fundamental blocks, punches, kicks, and stances- Kata — Pre-arranged forms simulating combat situations- Kumite — Sparring In each category, the beginner is given instruction at the most basic level until the techniques become spontaneous to them. As the student progresses technically, the practice progresses physically and the student begins to build greater stamina. At this stage, one involves himself or herself with the more intricate and difficult kata and more dynamic forms of kumite. Karate as self-defense is one of the most dynamic of all the martial arts. The trained karate student is able to coordinate the mind and body perfectly, thereby allowing one to unleash tremendous physical power at will. It is not the possession of great physical strength that makes a strong karateka; rather it is the ability to coordinate the mind and body. Upon developing this ability, even the smallest person finds that within themselves is the power to deliver a devastating blow to any would-be attacker. The values of karate to modern life are numerous. In our everyday lives we often forget the value of exercise to both our physical and mental health. The practice of karate tones the body, develops coordination, quickens reflexes, and builds stamina. Also, the serious practice of karate develops composure, a clearer thought process, deeper insight into one's mental capabilities, and more self-confidence. In this, karate is not an end, but a means to an end. It is an activity in which advancing age is not a hindrance. Rather, it encourages proficiency and the keen coordination of mind and body.", "group": "Shotokan Karate of America Club", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/e3168f30-f857-48be-b1a6-7535a4169081145e546d-254a-4c3c-ab99-f9e06ba651c2.png", "audience": ["Rehearsal or Practice"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "BRIC Stock Pitch", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/11982500", "start": "2026-04-28T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-04-29T00:00:00+00:00", "location": "HLH 104 (trading room)", "description": "BRIC Stock Pitch Session", "group": "Big Red Investment Club", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/b45bd708-d1fb-48cc-988d-316f6ca7fe72fd827741-8e97-4401-a533-7fd5350a7dfe.png", "audience": ["Meeting"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "Engineering Student Advisory Board (eSAB) General Meeting", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/11429018", "start": "2026-04-28T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-04-29T00:00:00+00:00", "location": "Kiewit Hall A203", "description": "Members of the board meet in alternating cycles of general and committee meetings.

Comprehensive, challenging exercise is only one of the many benefits of karate practice. Teaching traditional karate-do as a serious art and way of life means much more. It ensures the original ideas of the founder are passed on to our students, so that we grow in all aspects of our lives. Altman Senpai pushes us to challenge ourselves and taste our life, to be more fully aware and conscientious at all times. Our karate practice can be very difficult. The main difficulty lies in training one's mind to be disciplined and focused. Remember, anyone can be lazy, because that is the easiest thing to do! Karate may be defined as a weapon-less means of self-defense. These techniques use all parts of the body to their maximum advantage. Our fundamental techniques are divided into three main aspects: - Kihon — Fundamental blocks, punches, kicks, and stances- Kata — Pre-arranged forms simulating combat situations- Kumite — Sparring In each category, the beginner is given instruction at the most basic level until the techniques become spontaneous to them. As the student progresses technically, the practice progresses physically and the student begins to build greater stamina. At this stage, one involves himself or herself with the more intricate and difficult kata and more dynamic forms of kumite. Karate as self-defense is one of the most dynamic of all the martial arts. The trained karate student is able to coordinate the mind and body perfectly, thereby allowing one to unleash tremendous physical power at will. It is not the possession of great physical strength that makes a strong karateka; rather it is the ability to coordinate the mind and body. Upon developing this ability, even the smallest person finds that within themselves is the power to deliver a devastating blow to any would-be attacker. The values of karate to modern life are numerous. In our everyday lives we often forget the value of exercise to both our physical and mental health. The practice of karate tones the body, develops coordination, quickens reflexes, and builds stamina. Also, the serious practice of karate develops composure, a clearer thought process, deeper insight into one's mental capabilities, and more self-confidence. In this, karate is not an end, but a means to an end. It is an activity in which advancing age is not a hindrance. Rather, it encourages proficiency and the keen coordination of mind and body.", "group": "Shotokan Karate of America Club", "image_url": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/fb85e20b-cb35-42b3-9db9-c2d5157916e30068319a-298f-41c1-a14b-48f0f75d1a97.png", "audience": ["Rehearsal or Practice"], "source": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/events"}, {"title": "Mid-Week Bible Study", "url": "https://unl.campuslabs.com/engage/event/12086926", "start": "2026-04-29T23:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-04-30T02:00:00+00:00", "location": "W213B Nebraska Hall", "description": "Join us for our Midweek Bible Study, held every Wednesday at 6:00 PM in W213B, Nebraska Hall.
