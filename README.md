# Raikes-Hacks-2026

Event discovery app built for Raikes Hackathon 2026. Find events, filter by category/date/price/location, create groups to attend together, and download calendar files.

## Getting Started

### Run the frontend

From the repo root in PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```
.\start.bat
```

This installs dependencies and starts the dev server. Then open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

> **Note:** If you've already run it once, `npm install` will be fast since packages are cached.
